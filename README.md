# Baby_Injection
A web app to remind parents of their babies' vaccine dates. Functional but needs improvement. Future plans to enhance it after gaining more experience.
# Vaccine Reminder Web App

## Project Overview
This was my Final Year Project where I created a web app that helps in reminding parents about the vaccine dates of their babies by registering them.

## Current Status
As it was made for my FYP, it is just functional and not beautifully designed. 

## Future Plans
In the future, after gaining much more experience, I will work on this project and try to bring it to life.

## Features
- Register babies with their vaccine schedules.
- Reminders for upcoming vaccine dates.
- Parents can take appointment dates and times.
- Doctors can look at and confirm the dates for appointments.
- Parents can see which vaccines need to be given and when.
- Email alerts sent one week before and one day before the vaccination date to help parents prepare.
- Future enhancements to include vaccine reminders for dogs and cats.

## Installation
This project was made with React in 2022.

## Contribution
Anyone can contribute to the project if they can help make it more beautiful.
